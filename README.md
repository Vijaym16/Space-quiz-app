## Description

The Space Quiz App is a simple, engaging web-based application designed to test and expand your knowledge of the cosmos. Built using fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), it provides an interactive multiple-choice quiz experience covering various topics related to space, including planets, stars, galaxies, and more.

This project serves as a practical example of creating a static website application with front-end logic.

## Demo

You can play the Space Quiz live here:

[**Live Demo on GitHub Pages**](YOUR_GITHUB_PAGES_URL_HERE)

**Note:** Remember to replace `YOUR_GITHUB_PAGES_URL_HERE` with the actual URL you got after enabling GitHub Pages for your repository.

## Features

* Interactive multiple-choice questions.
* Immediate feedback on whether an answer is correct or incorrect.
* Tracks and displays the user's score.
* Option to restart the quiz and play again.
* Simple and clean user interface.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structures the content of the quiz application.
* **CSS3:** Styles the application for a visually appealing and responsive layout.
* **JavaScript:** Implements the quiz logic, handles user interaction, score tracking, and question display.

## Setup and Installation (For Local Development)
